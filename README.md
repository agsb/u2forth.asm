## u2forth.asm

  Another forth virtual machine, simple and minimal.
  
  But this one is for use into avr microcontroler ATmega8, 
  with RISC 32 8bit registers [1], Harvard model, 8 MHz internal clock, 
  8k bytes of FLASH, 1k bytes of SRAM and 512 bytes for EEPROM.
  
  This is a experience in progress, using avr-gcc -mmcu=atmega8 and to make a startup code for avr-as

  this is a tribute to G. H. Ting, and his books, papers and perseverance.
  
  SURE, this readme needs updates !
  
  __Not operational yet 04/2021__
  
  # Goals
 
  ALL focus in be simple, be smaller and be smart for ATmega8 (ATtiny85 too)
  
  To self learn about (AVR) RISC assembler, using avr-gcc with "trampolines" and diferent levels of optimzations, to learn howto.
  
  "Programmers can use trampolined functions to implement tail-recursive function calls in stack-oriented programming languages.[1]"
  
  u2forth is based in eForth dictionary from Dr. Ting, except for
 
         1. using Indirect Thread Code, to minimize size of all 
         2. using interrupts, to have a live system (**)
         3. have a timer in miliseconds, vide 2 (**)
         4. do not use real PC and SP, vide 2
         5. forth core words and constants in flash, as imutable
         6. forth user words and constants in sram, as wipes to nothing
         7. all variables in sram, vide 6
         8. use of poolling USART, vide 2
         9. use of poolling I2C, vide 2 (**)
        10. NO checks for ANY words

 # Virtual CPU and uC
 
 A really virtual implementation of a forth CPU implies in NO specific opcodes of any real CPU into dictionary.
 
 No assembler instructions, nor calls, nor jumps, nor returns, not at all.
 
 The forth virtual cpu does opcodes defined by one byte, and executes the code from a indexed table of rotines defined in real assembler (ISA) for a family of real microprocessors. This may be a bit slow than specific optmized code, but is really portable as just the primitives must be coded in real assembler and all is done, because dicionary is immutable. 

# Dictionary
 
 the dictionary words can be leafs or twigs, only.
         
          the leafs only contain bytecodes,
         
          the twigs only contains address to words.
 
 The leafs are sequences (threads) of real cpu code without any calls or any jumps inside, else at end.
 
 The twigs are sequences of reference address for calls executed in order.
 
 In RiscV cpu opcodes, leafs are equivalent to link and leave, jal and jalr, and twigs to call and return, ;
 
  WARNING: Goal is create a small object code for make a handcraft assembled forth for atmega8
  
  WARNING: Much code was borrowed from internet, with GPL licence, please help me to get all references. 

# 

  Still now, the dictionary will be, in no especific order,
    
    NOOP=0, 
    
    THIS, ( literal LIT )
    
    CODE, ( leaf interpreter, the uC )
    
    NEXT, ENTER, EXIT, ( twig interpreter )
    
    JUMP, JUMPNZ, ( branch, ?branch, )
    
    RTP, R2P, P2R, ( R@, R>, >R, )
    
    DUPNZ, DUP, DROP, SWAP, OVER, ROT, ( as is )
    
    EQZ, LTZ, GTZ, ( =0, <0, >0, )
    
    AND, OR, XOR, INV, CPL, SHL, SHR, ( and, or, xor, inverse, negate, 2*, 2/, )
    
    PLUS, MINUS, MULTIPLY, DIVIDE, ( +, -, *, /, )
    
    UPLUS, UMULTIPLY, ( unsigned )
    
    /MOD, UM/MOD, (reminder of division, reminder unsigned division)
    
    DROP2, DUP2, ( 2DROP, 2DUP, as is )
    
    CSTORE, CFETCH, STORE, FETCH, ( C!, C@, !, @, )
    
    CMOVE, CCOMP, MOVE, COMP, ( CMOVE, CCOMPARE, MOVE, COMPARE, moves and compares )
    
    TICK, COMMA, 
    
    COLON, SEMICOLON, 
    
    RSP0, PSP0, TIB0, PAD0, PAD1, ( forth address constants)
    
    CELL, FALSE, TRUE, BL, PADZ, TIBZ (forth values constants )
    
    LAST, DP, LASTR, DPR,  ( forth address variables, last and dp for flash, lastr and dpr for sram )
    
    STATE, HERE, ( forth variables )
    
    ZERO, ONE, TWO, ( usefull values )
    // 0, 1, 2 (decimal)
    
    BS, LF, FF, CR, ESC, ( ascii usefull constants ) 
    // 8, 10, 12, 13,  27, (decimal)

    RXQU, RXCU, TXCU, IOSU, ( ?rx, rx@, tx@, io_, // pooled USART ) 
    
    SETP, GETP, (basic I/O pins)
    
# Words

The dictionary of words follow the classic structure, but lives part in FLASH, core imutable, and in SRAM, user temporary. 

  link, adress of previous word, as linked list;
  
  size, size of this word, limited to 31 chars (0x1F), and flags for __IMMEDIATE (0x80), EXCLUSIVE (0x40), HIDDEN (0x20)__;
  
  word, size characters with pad byte 0 when size is odd;
  
  opcode, a single byte with opcode for virtual uC, 0 Nop, 1 Leaf, 2 Twig, 3 - 7 reserved, 8 - 254 words coded in assembler
  
  parameters, a set of opcodes (if leaf) or a set of address of words (if twig)
  
As ATmega8 have only 8k bytes of FLASH then 
  still no support for compile new words into FLASH, 
  still no support for use eeprom,
  sure all goes to SRAM, all goes to void.

# Constants and Variables

Those could be defined in assembler as .EQU for constants and as .DW for variables, 
but must be pushed at top of parameter stack

The forth internal constants are

  address: PSP0, RSP0, TIB0, PAD0
  
  values: CELL, FALSE, TRUE, PAD, TIB, BL, ZERO, ONE, TWO
  
  ascii:  \0, \a, \b, \t, \n, \v, \f, \r, \e
 
The forth internal variables are static in sram

  NP, UP, CP, LAST, BASE, SPAN, HLD, CONTEXT. CURRENT, HANDLE, TIN,  

# Details

-- In Risc-V, x0 is always zero. --

  Most of Forths are created in 1980 decade, for CPUs with few registers and diferent cycles per instructions, and uses a classic virtual model as (under) but uses internal CPU registers extras to scratch and speed.
  
  __IP__    index pointer
  
  __RSP__   return stack pointer
  
  __PSP__   parameter stack pointer
  
  __TOS__   top (first cell) of parameter stack
  
  __W__     work cell scratch
  
  Nowadays, most RISC cpus have at least 32 registers plus Program Counter, Stack Pointer and Status Register, and same cycles per instructions, almost, then to optimize the overhead of memory access, we adopt a virtual model with upto 255 opcodes and registers defined as (under) with ATmega8 registers
 
  __C__    temporary opcode instruction byte, r00   
  
  __NIL__  reserved always 0, r01, ( also modern RISC V uses X00 hardwired as ZERO )
  
  __IP__   instruction index pointer, r30r31 also know as Z register
  
  __RSP__  parameter stack pointer index (rsp), r28r29, also know as Y register
  
  __PSP__  return stack pointer index (psp), r26r27, also know as X register
  
  __W__    work cell for exchange values, r24r25 
  
  __N__    second cell of parameter stack, r22r23 
  
  __TOS__  first cell of parameter stack, r20r21 
  
  SP          Not used, reserved for real cpu and interrupts :)
  
  PC          Not used, reserved for real cpu work :)
  
  ( r2 to r15 are free and can direct accessed with @ and !, it works for Port IOs too. )
  
  (r0, r1, r2, r3, are used in internal mul* and fmul* instructions)
  
  and obey avr-gcc header stats:
   
   __SREG__      Status register at address0x3F
   
   __SP_H__      Stack pointer high byte ataddress 0x3E
   
   __SP_L__      Stack pointer low byte ataddress  0x3D
   
   __tmp_reg__   Register r0, used for temporary storage
   
   __zero_reg__  Register r1, always zero
   
   __PC__        Program counter
   
   __SP__        Stack pointer

#  why do not use SP as forth register ?
 
  All functionality and times of call, return, push and pop, could be make with Z, Y, X at same cpu cycles.
  Many extern standart library functions uses SP for internal pass-thru registers, then better leave SP for it.
  In Forth there is no generic SP.
